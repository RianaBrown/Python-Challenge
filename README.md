# Python-Challenge

In this Challenge, I was tasked with creating a Python script to analyze the financial records of a company. I was given a financial dataset called budget_data.csv and asked to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values:

The total number of months included in the dataset

The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period


In the PyPoll Challenge, I was tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process.
Given to me was a set of poll data called election_data.csv. The dataset was composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". I then had to create a Python script that analyzed the votes and calculated each of the following values:

The total number of votes cast

A complete list of candidates who received votes

The percentage of votes each candidate won

The total number of votes each candidate won

The winner of the election based on popular vote

Lastly, I had to ensure that my final script printed the analysis to the terminal and then, had to export a text file with the results.
